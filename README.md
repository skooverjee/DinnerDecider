Dinner Decider
--------------

This is a basic application developed as part of the Udemy course:
'Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced'.

This application randomly 'decides' on a food, from a basic list of foods.
The list can be added to, and will be temporarily saved for the lifetime of the application.
